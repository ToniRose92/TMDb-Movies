# TMDb-Movies

## Project Description:

This project analyzes the performance of top directors based on various metrics such as total profit, average profit per film, popularity score, and profitability by genre. The project aims to identify the most successful directors based on these metrics and identify any trends or correlations that exist between the director, genre, and movie performance. The project uses data from the TMDb database to conduct this analysis.

## Files Used:

* 'tmdb_movies.csv': Contains information about movies such as budget, revenue, and genre.
* 'tn.movie_budgets.csv': Contains information about the budget and revenue of movies.
* 'tmdb_5000_credits.csv': Contains information about the crew members who worked on each movie.

## Methods:

* Data Cleaning: Duplicates, null values, and irrelevant columns were removed.
* Data Analysis: The data was analyzed to determine the total profit, average profit per film, and popularity score of each director. The profitability and popularity of movies based on the genre were also analyzed. The data was then used to create visualizations to help identify any trends or correlations.
* Data Visualization: Visualizations such as scatter plots, heatmaps, and bar graphs were used to represent the data.
* Conclusion: The project concludes by identifying the top directors based on the metrics used and discussing the limitations of the data used.

## Acknowledgments:

The data used in this project was obtained from the TMDb database.
